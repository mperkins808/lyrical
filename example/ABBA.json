dig\nHistorien upprepar sig\n\nWaterloo - jag är besegrad, nu ger jag mig\nWaterloo - lova mej nöjet att älska dig\nWaterloo - allting känns rätt, och det är min tro\nWaterloo - du är mitt öde, mitt Waterloo\nWa Wa Wa Wa Waterloo - du är mitt öde, mitt Waterloo\n\n\nJo, jo, man värjer sig och fäktas i det längsta\nMen, men, mot känslor kämpar gudarna förgäves har man sagt\nDet är som jag hörde en sång\nJag tror det är kärlek på gång\n\nWaterloo - så har man funnit sin överman\nWaterloo - mäktig och väldig och stark är han\nWaterloo - allting känns rätt, och det är min tro\nWaterloo - du är mitt öde, mitt Waterloo\nWa Wa Wa Wa Waterloo - du är mitt öde, mitt Waterloo\n\nDet är som jag hörde en sång\nJag tror det är kärlek på gång\n\n\nWaterloo - allting känns rätt, och det är min
