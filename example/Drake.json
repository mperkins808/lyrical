Do that shit again\n\nHow you got a manager you met after you got the win?\n\nBet you got some niggas that'll love you 'til the bitter end\n\nBet you got somebody that's just smarter than your other friends\n\nGive 'em a percentage, see what happens to your blessings then\n\nYou just need to stay close to your people that was there when others could've been\n\nThan when others should've been\n\nGot a nigga starin' at the game like, \"Damn, coach, put him in\"\n\nBut you never listen, so you niggas goin' wood again\n\nGot us in the crib, talkin' 'bout what niggas coulda been, shoulda been\n\nAnd I got your girl on the second floor, beggin' me to put it in\n\nAnd it's not because all of the money that you wouldn't spend\n\nAnd it's not because I set it up to try and get revenge\n\nIt's because you niggas insecure, you ain't made men\n\nIt's because even though you hate on me, we stay friends\n\nIt's because you niggas never learn when to say when\n\nYeah\n\n\n\nFor real\n\nFacts, you know what I'm sayin'?\n\nHahaha, yeah"

Time on your hands or time on your side?\n\nIs there any sense in doin' these songs when I'm high?\n\nIs there more to life than goin' on trips to Dubai?\n\nYachts on 4th of July, G5 soarin' the skies\n\nIs there more to life than all of these corporate ties\n\nAnd all of these fortunate times\n\nAnd all of these asses that never come in proportionate size?\n\nAm I missin' somethin' that's more important to find?\n\nLike healin' my soul, like family time\n\n\n\nIs there more to life than just when I'm feelin' alive?\n\nIs there more?\n\n\n\nPassion, instant\n\nSweat beads, feel me (feel me)\n\nCupid's shot me\n\nMy heartbeat's racing (my heartbeat's racing)\n\nTempt me, drive me (tempt me)\n\nFeels so exciting\n\nThought of highly (highly)\n\nIt's yours entirely\n\nI'll be, I'll be more than a lover\n\nMore than a woman\n\nMore than your lover for you"

I got it, I'll take us wherever\nI'm a staple in the game, all my papers together\nAnd my life is on display like Truman\nThey wanna pre the movements, gotta start to make 'em sooner\nMy exes made some of my favorite music\nI dated women from my favorite movies\nKarma's such a thing of beauty\nI'd share more of my story but you wouldn't believe it\nIt's far fetched like I threw that shit a hundred meters\nI keep it 100 like I'm running a fever\nI might take a breather but I won't ever leave you\n\nIf I was you, I wouldn't like me either"
