more fear\n\nAccumulated 10 times over throughout the years\n\nMy newfound life made all of me magnified\n\nHow many accolades do I need to block denial?\n\nThe shock value of my success put bolts in me\n\nAll this money, is God playin' a joke on me?\n\nIs it for the moment and will he see me as Job?\n\nTake it from me and leave me worse than I was before?\n\nAt 27, my biggest fear was losin' it all\n\nScared to spend money, had me sleepin' from hall to hall\n\nScared to go back to Section 8 with my mama stressin'\n\n30 shows a month and I still won't buy me no Lexus\n\nWhat is an advisor somebody that's holdin' my checks?\n\nJust to fuck me over and put my finances in debt?\n\nI read a case about Rihanna's accountant and wondered\n\nHow did the bad girl feel when she looked at them numbers?\n\nThe type of shit'll make me flip out\n\nAnd just kill somethin', drill somethin'\n\nGet ill and fill ratchets with a lil' somethin'\n\nI practiced runnin' from fear, guess I had some good luck\n\nAt 27 years old, my biggest fear was bein' judged\n\nHow they look at me reflect on myself, my family, my city\n\nWhat they say 'bout me reveal\n\nIf my reputation would miss me\n\nWhat they see from me\n\nWould trickle down generations in time\n\nWhat they hear from me\n\nWould make 'em highlight my simplest lines\n\n\n\nI'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' creativity\n\nI'm talkin' fear, fear of missin' out on you and me\n\nI'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' loyalty from pride\n\n'cause my DNA won't let me involve in the light of God\n\nI'm talkin' fear, fear that my humbleness is gone\n\nI'm talkin' fear, fear that love ain't livin' here no more\n\nI'm talkin' fear, fear that it's wickedness or weakness\n\nFear, whatever it is, both is distinctive\n\nFear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth\n\nAnd I can't take these feelings\n\nWith me so hopefully they disperse\n\nWithin fourteen tracks, carried out over wax\n\nSearchin' for resolutions until somebody get back\n\nFear, what happens on earth stays on earth\n\nAnd I can't take these feelings with me\n\nSo hopefully they disperse\n\nWithin fourteen tracks, carried out over wax\n\nWonderin' if I'm livin' through fear or livin' through rap\n\n\n\nDamn\n\nGoddamn you\n\nGoddamn me\n\nGoddamn us\n\nGoddamn we\n\nGoddamn us all\n\n\n\nVerse two says you only have I known of all the families of the earth, therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities. So until we come back to these commandments, until you come back to these commandments, we're gonna be in this place, we're gonna be under this curse. Because he said he's gonna punish us, the so-called Blacks, Hispanics, and Native American Indians, are the true children of Israel. We are the Israelites according to the Bible. The children of Israel, he's gonna punish us for our inequities. For our disobedience because we chose to follow other gods that aren't his son, so the Lord thy God chasten you. So just like your children, your own son, he's gonna chastise you because he loves you. So that's why we get chastised, that's why we're in the position we're in. Until we come back to these laws, statutes and commandments, and do what the Lord said, these curses are gonna be upon us. We're gonna be at a lower state in this life that we live here in today, in the United States of America. I love you, son, and I pray for you.

around me\nSo I went running for answers\nUntil I came home\nBut that didn't stop survivor's guilt\nGoing back and forth trying to convince myself the stripes I earned\nOr maybe how A-1 my foundation was\nBut while my loved ones was fighting the continuous war back in the city\nI was entering a new one\nA war that was based on apartheid and discrimination\nMade me wanna go back to the city and tell the homies what I learned\nThe word was respect\nJust because you wore a different gang color than mine's\nDoesn't mean I can't respect you as a black man\nForgetting all the pain and hurt we caused each other in these streets\nIf I respect you, we unify and stop the enemy from killing us\nBut I don't know, I'm no mortal man\nMaybe I'm just another nigga”\n\nShit and that's all I wrote\nI was gonna call it \"Another Nigga\" but, it ain't really a poem\nI just felt like it's something you probably could relate to\nOther than that, now that I finally got a chance to holla at you\nI always wanted to ask you about a certain situa-\nAbout a metaphor actually, uh, you spoke on the ground\nWhat you mean by that, what the ground represent?\n\nThe ground is gonna open up and swallow the evil\nRight\nThat's how I see it, my word is bond\nI see and the ground is the symbol for the poor people\nRight\nThe poor people is gonna open up this whole world\nAnd swallow up the rich people\n'Cause the rich people gonna be so fat\nAnd they gonna be so appetizing, you know what I'm saying Wealthy, appetizing\nThe poor gonna be so poor, and hungry\nRight\nYou know what I'm saying,

you this then\nDo you see yourself as somebody that's rich\nOr somebody that made the best of they own opportunities?\n\nI see myself as a natural born hustler\nA true hustler in every sense of the word\nI took nothin', I took the opportunities\nI worked at the most menial and degrading job\nAnd built myself up so I could get it to where I owned it\nI went from having somebody managing me\nTo me hiring the person that works my management company\nI changed everything, I realized my destiny\nIn a matter of five years, you know what I'm saying?\nI made myself a millionaire, I made millions for a lot of people\nNow it's time to make millions for myself, you know what I'm saying?\nI made millions for the record companies\nI made millions for these movie companies\nNow I make millions for, for us\n\nAnd through your different avenues of success\nHow would you say you managed to keep a level of sanity?\n\nBy my faith in God, by my faith in the game\nAnd by my faith in \"all good things come to those that stay true\"\nRight\nYou know what I'm saying?\nAnd it was happening to me for a reason\nYou know what I'm saying, I was noticing, shit\nI was punching the right buttons and it was happening\nSo it's no problem, you know\nI mean, it's a problem but I'm not finna let them know\nI'm finna go straight through\n\nWould you consider yourself a fighter at heart or somebody that\nSomebody that only reacts when they back is against the wall?\n\nShit, I like to think that at every opportunity I've ever been, uh Threatened with resistance, it's been met with resistance\nAnd not only me but, it goes down my family tree\nYou know what I'm saying, it's in my veins to fight back\n\nAight well, how long will you think it take before niggas be like\n\"We fighting a war, I'm fighting a war I can't win\nAnd I wanna lay it all down\"\n\nIn this country, a black man only have like\n5 years we can exhibit maximum strength\nAnd that's right now while you a teenager, while you still strong\nWhile you still wanna lift weights, while you still wanna shoot back\n'Cause once you turn 30 it's like\nThey take the heart and soul out of a man\nOut of a black man, in this country\nAnd you don't wanna fight no more\nAnd if you don't believe me, you can look around\nYou don't see no loud mouth 30-year old motherfuckers\n\nThat's crazy, because me being one of your offsprings\nOf the legacy you left behind, I can truly tell you that\nThere's nothing but turmoil goin' on so, I wanted to ask you\nWhat you think is the future for me and my generation today?\n\nI think that niggas is tired of grabbin' shit out the stores\nAnd next time it's a riot it's gonna be like, uh, bloodshed\nFor real, I don't think America know that\nI think America think we was just playing\nAnd it's gonna be some more playing but\nIt ain't gonna be no playing\nIt's gonna be murder, you know what I'm saying?\nIt's gonna be like Nat Turner, 1831, up in this motherfucker\nYou know what I'm saying, it's gonna happen\n\nThat's crazy man, in my opinion\nOnly hope that we kinda have left is music and vibrations\nLot a people don't understand how important it is, you know\nSometimes I can like, get behind a mic\nAnd I don't know what type of energy I'ma push out\nOr where it comes from, trip me out sometimes\n\nBecause it's spirits, we ain't even really rappin'\nWe just letting our dead homies tell stories for us\nDamn\n\nI wanted to read one last thing to you\nIt's actually something a good friend had wrote\nDescribing my world, it says:\n“The caterpillar is a prisoner to the streets that conceived it\nIts only job is to eat or consume everything around it\nIn order to protect itself from this mad city\nWhile consuming its environment\nThe caterpillar begins to notice ways to survive\nOne thing it noticed is how much the world shuns him\nBut praises the butterfly\nThe butterfly represents the talent, the thoughtfulness\nAnd the beauty within the caterpillar\nBut having a harsh outlook on life\nThe caterpillar sees the butterfly as weak\nAnd figures out a way to pimp it to his own benefits\nAlready surrounded by this mad city\nThe caterpillar goes to work on the cocoon\nWhich institutionalizes him\nHe can no longer see past his own thoughts\nHe's trapped\nWhen trapped inside these walls certain ideas take root, such as\nGoing home, and bringing back new concepts to this mad city\nThe result?\nWings begin to emerge, breaking the cycle of feeling stagnant\nFinally free, the butterfly sheds light on situations\nThat the caterpillar never considered, ending the internal struggle\nAlthough the butterfly and caterpillar are completely different\nThey are one and the same\"\nWhat's your perspective on that?\nPac?
