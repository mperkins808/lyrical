me\n(Love me, love me, love me) You love me\n\n\nLike the Lion of Judah (Judah)\nI strike my enemies down\nAs my God is living\nSurely the trumpet will sound\n\nThere was one who would stand by my side\nThrough the good and the bad\nLet that one stand with pride\nThe best that I've ever had\nLike the Lion of Judah\n\n\n\nDriving away with a smile on my face\nWind blowing through my hair\nWondering how you'll feel when you find out\nHow much I really care (I care)\nHoping that the tears roll down your face (Down your face)\nYour body grasps who we are (Who are we?)\nTwo gypsy beggars who only by Vegas\nCame to be a star\n(A super star) A star\nThat's what we are\n\n\nLike the Lion of Judah (Judah)\nI strike my enemies down\nAs my God is living\nSurely the trumpet will sound\n\nLion of Judah\nLion of Judah\n\n\n\n\nLike the Lion of Judah (Judah)\nI strike my enemies down\nLike the Lion of Judah (Judah)\nSurely you, going to hear the trumpet sound\nHear the trumpet will sound (oh)\nLion...
